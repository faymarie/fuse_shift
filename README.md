# README

Still Missing:

1. Registration App:

IN REGISTRATIONS:
* hashed-email: correct ugly small mistakes in the validation-message for emails, originating from validating the email with attribute hashed-email not the email itself: 
  * email-field should be red, when invalid
  * "email has already been taken" instead of "Hashedemail has already been taken".
* attributes shifts and languages
* some validations
* tests

OTHER TASKS

ONLY ADMIN-ACCESS
* input shifts
* upload public key (maybe not)
* download data

Notes: One user has to be able to make several registrations

LATER:
* action for adjusting labels and helptext for the input-fields


2. Evalutation App
....

DONE:
* registration
* encrpytion
* hashed email for id
* edit-view
