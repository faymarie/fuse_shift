# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      You confirmed your email-adress.

      Editing previous registrations might become a little bit more confusing, if you delete your site data in between. Consider to keep them until the festival.

      You can now start to enter registrations.
    delete_cookie_data: |
      The data that was saved in your cookie is deleted. We still have your encrypted registrations.
    
      You can't see the registration data itself anymore, but you can still identify single registrations by their IDs. Look the IDs up in your emails to connect them with names.
